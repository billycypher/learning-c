# What is a compiler

[:brazil: Leia isso em portuguÃªs do Brasil](README.PT-BR.md)

The [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) is a program (or more) 
that takes the high-level language (which is the language that human beings 
understand) and transforms it into the low-level language (which is the 
language the computer understands).
